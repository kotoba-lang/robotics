  "Operator-facing safety console for a robotics actor.

  Renders an HTML read-only panel of robot missions and the governor's
  action gate decisions, using kotoba-lang/html + css. Pure data → markup:
  no network, no DOM. The governor gates hardware dispatch; this view only
  observes missions, actions and sign-off state — it never dispatches."
