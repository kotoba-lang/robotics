  "Robot missions, actions and safety — pure data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library that gives every cloud-itonami open
  business a single, cross-cutting robotics contract. All cloud-itonami
  verticals are designed on the premise that a robot performs the physical
  domain work (drive, grasp, pour, clean, deliver, …) under an actor that
  proposes actions and an independent governor that gates them.

  Models: a mission (1 mission = 1 bounded operation, no infinite internal
  loop — durable outer loops repeat missions), an action with a safety
  classification, a safety-stop, and a telemetry proof that links robot
  sensing to the audit ledger. No network, no I/O.

  The library is policy, not control. It does not drive motors; it gives a
  governor the records it needs to refuse unsafe actuation before it ever
  reaches hardware. Portable (.cljc) across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI /
  GraalVM."
