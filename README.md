# kotoba-robotics

[![CI](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/robotics/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/robotics/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Robot missions, actions and safety in pure Clojure.** The cross-cutting
[kotoba-lang](https://github.com/kotoba-lang) capability that every
`cloud-itonami-*` open business requires: all itonami verticals are designed
on the premise that a robot performs the physical domain work (drive, grasp,
pour, clean, deliver, …) under an actor that proposes actions and an
independent governor that gates them.

Models a **mission** (1 mission = 1 bounded operation; a durable outer loop
repeats missions — a single mission never loops internally), an **action**
with a safety classification, a **safety-stop**, and a **telemetry proof**
that links robot sensing to the audit ledger.

This library is **policy, not control**. It does not drive motors; it gives a
governor the records it needs to refuse unsafe actuation before it ever
reaches hardware. No network, no I/O. Portable `.cljc` across JVM /
ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM.

## Contract

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.robotics :as rob])

(rob/mission "M1" "robot-1" "deliver parcel" :boundaries {:geo "site-A"} :max-steps 100)
(rob/action "A1" "M1" :move :low :params {:to [0 1]})
(rob/requires-sign-off? (rob/action "A1" "M1" :grasp :safety-critical)) ; => true
(rob/safety-stop "M1" :e-stop :source "operator")
(rob/telemetry-proof "M1" :lidar {:range 3.2} :timestamp "2026-07-01T00:00Z")
(rob/gate action #{:none :low})   ; => {:gate/decision :permit}
```

## Safety model

| class | actuates hardware? | sign-off? |
|---|---|---|
| `:none` / `:low` / `:medium` | varies | no |
| `:high` / `:safety-critical` | yes | **yes** (interrupt-before) |

The governor refuses any action whose safety class is not in the operator's
allowed set, and routes `:high`/`:safety-critical` to a human sign-off
(human-in-the-loop) before the action may be dispatched to hardware.

## Operator console (UI/UX)

A read-only HTML dashboard renders missions and the governor action gate (safety-class color badges) for an operator. Built on
[`kotoba-lang/html`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/html) (Hiccup→HTML) +
[`kotoba-lang/css`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/css) (EDN→CSS). Pure data
→ markup; the console never exposes a write surface (no `<form>`/`<button>`)
— writes stay behind the governor.

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.robotics.ui :as ui])

(ui/dashboard
  {:missions [(rob/mission "M1" "robot-1" "deliver parcel")]
   :actions [(rob/action "A1" "M1" :move :low)
             (rob/action "A2" "M1" :grasp :safety-critical)]
   :allowed-safety #{:none :low :medium :safety-critical}})
;; => "<html>...read-only · governor-gated...</html>"
```

## Export (CSV / JSON)

Audit-grade CSV (RFC-4180 quoting) and JSON (quote/backslash/newline
escaped) for missions and actions (with governor gate decision).

```clojure
(require '[kotoba.robotics.export :as ex])

(ex/missions->csv missions)
(ex/actions->csv actions #{:none :low :medium :safety-critical}) ; governor gate column
(ex/missions->json missions)
```

## Why

A robot performing physical work in a community (last-mile delivery, water
sampling, materials sorting, cleaning, construction) can cause real-world
harm. The single invariant — **a governor never permits an action it should
refuse, and never dispatches hardware itself** — is what makes an LLM-driven
actor safe to operate robotics in public. `kotoba-robotics` is the pure-data
layer the governor checks against; the audit ledger records every action,
hold and sign-off.

## Process physics (`kotoba.robotics.process`)

What the robot physically does, declared as data and run by one probe. A
vertical writes `physics.edn` (schema `itonami.physical-ai.spec.v1`: cases of
`:kind`, `:params`, a `:sweep`, the `:quantity` a `:limit` judges, the limit's
`:basis`, an optional `:boundary` to bisect) and names
`:physics {:main-opts ["-m" "kotoba.robotics.process.probe"]}`; the probe
prints one `itonami.physical-ai.probe.v1` map (exit 2 = could not measure).

| `:kind` | solver | held to (tests) |
|---|---|---|
| `:transport` | force/accel/brake-limited longitudinal dynamics, semi-implicit Euler | trapezoid closed form; stall under an unmovable payload |
| `:manipulator` | 2-link arm IK + quintic trajectory + rigid-body inverse dynamics | static moment of the weights; joint work = ΔPE (work–energy) |
| `:material` | kudaki explicit J2 truss, quasi-static load ramp | stiffness = EA/L within 2 %; yield load within 5 % of σy·A |
| `:thermal` | 1-D FTCS slab, convective or fixed faces | linear steady profile; adiabatic heat conservation |
| `:tank-drain` | Torricelli, RK2 | closed-form drain time |
| `:pipe-flow` | Darcy–Weisbach, Colebrook | 64/Re laminar; Haaland within 2 % |

A run whose solver threw is not counted; a physical "cannot" (stall,
unreachable, never drains) is a measurement and out of tolerance.
